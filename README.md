This is a submission for the Apex Frontend Developer Assessment
## Steps to Start Contributing

- Clone the repo to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/atmgc/onthejob-frontend.git` [First time only]
- Create and checkout a local branch with the name of your update/feature from the `main` branch using `git checkout -b [branch-name]`
- implement your feature/update
- Create a Pull Request for any feature you work on, DO NOT push directly to the `main` branch, if there is a merge conflict, resolve it carefully without deleting other contributor's task (There is git blame to point you out)
- Our GitHub flow will automatically deploy your PR to a preview link, use that to test your work in the live environment.
- Your PR will be reviewed and merged accordingly.
- To work on the next feature, check back to the `main` branch and pull before going to step 2.

\*\* Our code base follows the [AirBnB React Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/) and [Udacity Git Style](http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/). Follow these as much as possible.
